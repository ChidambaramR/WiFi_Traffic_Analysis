WiFi_Traffic_Analysis
=====================

This project involves capturing the IEEE 802.11 packets on the air and making inferences on the collected traces

A team of two members worked on the project. The project required each of them to collect traces of 802.11 packets at various hot spots in the university. The collected packets were brought together and a performance analysis was made. The results were recorded in the report attached. 

A wealth of information was obtained. Certain attributes like throughput, efficiency etc were studied.
